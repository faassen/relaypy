# This is a basic end-to-end test, designed to demonstrate the various
# capabilities of a Relay-compliant GraphQL server.
#
# It is recommended that readers of this test be familiar with
# the end-to-end test in GraphQL.js first, as this test skips
# over the basics covered there in favor of illustrating the
# key aspects of the Relay spec that this test is designed to illustrate.
#
# We will create a GraphQL schema that describes the major
# factions and ships in the original Star Wars trilogy.
#
# NOTE: This may contain spoilers for the original Star
# Wars trilogy.

# Using our shorthand to describe type systems, the type system for our
# example will be the followng:
#
# interface Node {
#   id: ID!
# }
#
# type Faction : Node {
#   id: ID!
#   name: String
#   ships: ShipConnection
# }
#
# type Ship : Node {
#   id: ID!
#   name: String
# }
#
# type ShipConnection {
#   edges: [ShipEdge]
#   pageInfo: PageInfo!
# }
#
# type ShipEdge {
#   cursor: String!
#   node: Ship
# }
#
# type PageInfo {
#   hasNextPage: Boolean!
#   hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
#   startCursor: String
#   endCursor: String
# }
#
# type Query {
#   rebels: Faction
#   empire: Faction
#   node(id: ID!): Node
# }
#
# input IntroduceShipInput {
#   clientMutationId: string!
#   shipName: string!
#   factionId: ID!
# }
#
# input IntroduceShipPayload {
#   clientMutationId: string!
#   ship: Ship
#   faction: Faction
# }
#
# type Mutation {
#   introduceShip(input IntroduceShipInput!): IntroduceShipPayload
# }

# We get the node interface and field from the relay library.
#
# The first method is the way we resolve an ID to its object. The second is the
# way we resolve an object that implements node to its type.
